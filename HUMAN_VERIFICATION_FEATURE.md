# Human Verification Calculator - Contact Form

## Feature Added

Added a simple math-based human verification system to the contact form to prevent spam submissions.

## How It Works

### User Experience:
1. **Random Question Generated**: User sees a simple addition problem (e.g., "7 + 3 = ?")
2. **User Enters Answer**: Types the answer in the input field
3. **Real-time Verification**: 
   - ✅ **Correct answer**: Input turns green with checkmark, "Send Message" button activates
   - ❌ **Wrong answer**: Input turns red with error message
4. **New Question**: User can click "Generate new question" for a different problem
5. **Form Submission**: "Send Message" button only works when verification is complete

### Visual Feedback:
- **Unverified State**: Gray disabled button with helper text
- **Correct Answer**: Green input field with checkmark icon
- **Wrong Answer**: Red input field with error message
- **Button States**: Disabled (gray) or enabled (blue gradient)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
**`src/pages/ContactPage.jsx`**

### State Management:
```jsx
const [num1, setNum1] = useState(0)           // First number
const [num2, setNum2] = useState(0)           // Second number
const [userAnswer, setUserAnswer] = useState('') // User's input
const [isVerified, setIsVerified] = useState(false) // Verification status
```

### Key Functions:

1. **`generateNewQuestion()`**
   - Creates two random numbers (1-10)
   - Resets user answer and verification status

2. **`checkAnswer(value)`**
   - Validates user's answer in real-time
   - Updates verification status immediately

### Features:

✅ **Real-time Validation**: Checks answer as user types
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded inputs (green/red/gray)
✅ **Button State Management**: Disabled until verified
✅ **Generate New Question**: Users can get a different problem
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
✅ **Accessible**: Clear labels and status messages
✅ **User-Friendly**: Simple addition (numbers 1-10)

## Design

### Verification Section Styling:
- Light teal gradient background
- Shield icon for security
- Large, clear math problem display
- Color-coded feedback (green = correct, red = wrong)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Button States:
```jsx
// Disabled (not verified):
bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed opacity-60

// Enabled (verified):
bg-nai-highlight hover:bg-nai-deep-teal text-white shadow-lg
```

## Benefits

1. **Spam Prevention**: Simple but effective bot deterrent
2. **User-Friendly**: Easy math problem (not annoying CAPTCHAs)
3. **No External Services**: No reCAPTCHA API needed
4. **Fast**: Instant validation
5. **Accessible**: Works with keyboard navigation
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design
7. **Privacy**: No tracking or external requests

## Testing

✅ Form submission only works when verified
✅ Generate new question feature works
✅ Visual feedback is clear and immediate

## Example Flow

```
1. User fills out contact form
2. Sees: "7 + 3 = ?" with input box
3. Types "10"
4. Input turns green ✓ "Verified!"
5. "Send Message" button becomes active (blue)
6. User can now submit the form
```

## Security Note

This is a **simple human verification** system designed to:
