# OSCE Success: Excelling in Patient Assessment Like a Pro

Title : OSCE Success: Excelling in Patient Assessment Like a Pro
MAR 05
In the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), patient
assessment is a core competency. Examiners expect you to perform a
comprehensive assessment quickly and methodically. Here are the keys to
success.
Use the A to E Assessment – This systematic approach covers Airway,
Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure. Start by checking that
the airway is open, assess breathing rate and quality, take vital signs,
check for neurological deficits and inspect the patient fully for
injuries or abnormalities.
Avoid Common Pitfalls – Many candidates skip steps or forget to
communicate findings. Always explain what you’re doing, obtain consent
and document clearly. If you identify abnormal findings, prioritize them
and call for help when needed.
Final Success Tips – Practice under timed conditions and simulate
real‑world scenarios. Develop a routine so you don’t miss any step.
Enrolling in a structured OSCE course like NAI’s will give you feedback
and improve confidence.
