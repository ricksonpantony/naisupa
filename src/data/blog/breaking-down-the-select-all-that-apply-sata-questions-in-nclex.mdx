#  Breaking Down the “Select All That Apply” (SATA) Questions in NCLEX

Title :
Breaking Down the “Select All That Apply” (SATA) Questions in NCLEX
DEC 23
“Select All That Apply” questions intimidate many NCLEX candidates
because there is no partial credit. This article demystifies them and
offers strategies for success.
Why They’re Challenging – SATA questions can cover multiple correct
answers, require critical thinking and often use tricky wording.
Purpose and Topics – These questions test your ability to recognise
signs and symptoms, interventions, side effects and patient teaching for
various conditions.
Strategies – Treat each option as true or false, pay attention to
keywords, focus on the question stem, beware of distractors, use
elimination and avoid overthinking. Practice regularly to build
confidence.
Example Question and Rationale – A sample SATA question with explained
rationale helps you understand how to apply the strategies. Common
mistakes include guessing without analysis and neglecting to read all
options. Regular practice with rationales reinforces learning.
