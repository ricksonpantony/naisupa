# Silent Station: A Hidden Challenge in OSCE

Title : Silent Station: A Hidden Challenge in OSCE
OCT 24
Some OSCE stations require you to complete tasks silently, without
speaking to a patient or examiner. This “silent station” can be daunting
but is a valuable opportunity to demonstrate autonomy.
Purpose of the Silent Station – It assesses your ability to follow
written instructions, perform clinical tasks independently and
prioritize effectively.
Challenges – Lack of verbal feedback, tight time limits and the need to
rely solely on your own judgement can increase anxiety.
Strategies for Success – Read instructions carefully, practise
documentation and diagnostic reasoning, and stay calm. Simulate silent
practice sessions to build confidence.
