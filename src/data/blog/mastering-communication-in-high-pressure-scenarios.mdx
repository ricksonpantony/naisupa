# Mastering Communication in High‑Pressure Scenarios

Title : Mastering Communication in High‑Pressure Scenarios
NOV 08
Communication skills are just as important as clinical skills in the
OSCE. This article provides strategies for challenging interactions.
Breaking Bad News – Prepare by giving a warning shot, use simple
language and allow time for questions and emotional responses.
Handling Agitated Patients – Stay calm, use open body language and
employ “I” statements to de‑escalate situations.
Discussing Sensitive Topics – Ask open‑ended questions, use inclusive
language and be culturally sensitive. Show empathy and respect.
Build Confidence – Role‑play scenarios, practise mindfulness and seek
feedback to refine your communication skills.
