# The Importance of Reflective Practice in OSCE Success

Title : The Importance of Reflective Practice in OSCE Success
JAN 09
Reflective practice is a powerful tool for improving performance in the
OSCE. It involves systematically evaluating your experiences to identify
strengths and areas for improvement.
Self‑Assessment – After each practice session, ask yourself what went
well and what could have gone better.
Utilize Feedback – Incorporate feedback from instructors and peers to
refine your skills.
Action Plans – Set specific goals based on your reflections and track
your progress.
Reflective practice enhances clinical skills, communication, time
management and confidence. Frameworks like Gibbs’ reflective cycle can
guide your reflection. NAI incorporates reflective practice into its
training through structured feedback and coaching.
