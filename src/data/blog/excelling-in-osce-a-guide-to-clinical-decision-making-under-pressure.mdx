#  Excelling in OSCE: A Guide to Clinical Decision‑Making Under Pressure

Title :
Excelling in OSCE: A Guide to Clinical Decision‑Making Under Pressure
FEB 19
Clinical decision‑making is tested rigorously in the OSCE. This article
explains how to approach complex scenarios calmly and methodically.
Manage a Deteriorating Patient – Use the ABCDE (Airway, Breathing,
Circulation, Disability, Exposure) framework. Recognize signs of
deterioration early, initiate basic interventions and call for help.
Recognize and Escalate Sepsis – Know the SEPSIS SIX: oxygen, blood
cultures, IV antibiotics, IV fluids, lactate measurement and urine
output monitoring. Acting quickly can save lives.
Prioritize Multiple Patients – When presented with several patients, use
SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) and triage
principles. Focus first on airway and breathing issues, then circulation
and pain.
Stay Calm Under Pressure – Practice using structured frameworks, justify
your actions out loud and always consider patient safety. NAI’s OSCE
program offers simulation and feedback to build confidence.
