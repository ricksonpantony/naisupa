#  NCLEX Mastery: Breaking Down Infection Control & Isolation Precautions

Title :
NCLEX Mastery: Breaking Down Infection Control & Isolation Precautions
FEB 27
Infection control is a vital component of nursing practice and a
frequent topic on the NCLEX. Understanding the four types of isolation
precautions and how to apply them will help you answer related questions
correctly.
Standard Precautions – Used for all patients, these include hand hygiene
and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent
the spread of infection.
Contact Precautions – Required for infections spread by direct contact
(e.g., MRSA, C. difficile). Wear gloves and gowns; dedicate equipment to
the patient to avoid cross‑contamination.
Droplet Precautions – Used for respiratory infections like influenza.
Wear a surgical mask within one metre of the patient; the patient should
wear a mask when transported.
Airborne Precautions – Used for infections like tuberculosis and
measles. Place the patient in a negative‑pressure room and wear an N95
respirator. Limit transport.
PPE Donning and Doffing Order – Don gloves last when donning and remove
gloves first when doffing. Always perform hand hygiene before and after
removing PPE.
Remember to wash your hands frequently, identify the type of isolation
required and apply the correct precautions.
