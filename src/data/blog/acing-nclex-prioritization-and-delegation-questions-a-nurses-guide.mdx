#  Acing NCLEX Prioritization and Delegation Questions: A Nurse’s Guide

Title :
Acing NCLEX Prioritization and Delegation Questions: A Nurse’s Guide
FEB 17
Many NCLEX questions require you to decide which patient to see first or
which tasks to delegate. Here’s how to tackle them.
Prioritization – Use the ABCs and Maslow’s hierarchy. Address airway and
breathing problems before circulation; attend to physiological needs
before psychosocial concerns. Compare acute vs chronic conditions and
actual vs potential problems when deciding priority.
Delegation – Know the scope of practice for Registered Nurses,
Licensed/Enrolled Nurses and Assistants in Nursing. Delegating
appropriately protects patient safety and ensures tasks are completed
efficiently.
Strategies – Follow the nursing process (ADPIE), eliminate clearly
incorrect answers, think about patient safety and use common sense.
Practicing these scenarios will improve your ability to prioritize and
delegate effectively.
