# AURN Pathway Explained: Step‑by‑Step Guide for International Nurses in Australia

Title : AURN Pathway Explained: Step‑by‑Step Guide for International
Nurses in Australia
SEP 07
Becoming an Australian Registered Nurse (AURN) is a life‑changing
achievement for internationally qualified nurses. Not only does it open
the door to world‑class healthcare opportunities, but it also allows you
to live and work in one of the most beautiful, safe and rewarding
countries in the world.
However, the AURN pathway can feel overwhelming without a clear guide.
In this article, we break it down step‑by‑step so you know exactly what
to expect – and show how Nurse Assist International (NAI) can make the
process simpler, smoother and more successful.
What Does AURN Mean?
AURN stands for Australian Registered Nurse. To earn this qualification
you must meet the national standards set by the Nursing and
Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) and the Australian Health
Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Internationally educated nurses
must follow a specific pathway to prove they meet these standards.
1. Self‑Check – Before you do anything else, complete the AHPRA
self‑check to determine whether your nursing qualifications are
considered “substantially equivalent” to the Australian Bachelor of
Nursing. You’ll be asked about your highest nursing qualification, where
you obtained it and your years of experience. This step classifies you
as Stream A (equivalent), Stream B (similar but requiring additional
assessment) or Stream C (not equivalent).
2. Qualification Assessment – If you fall into Streams B or C, AHPRA
will perform a more detailed assessment of your qualification. You may
need to provide transcripts, course syllabi and evidence of clinical
hours. This determines whether you need to undertake further education
or bridging programs before moving forward.
3. English Language Proficiency – All international nurses must prove
they can communicate safely and effectively. This usually involves
sitting the IELTS Academic, OET Nursing, PTE Academic or TOEFL iBT and
achieving the minimum scores required by AHPRA.
4. NCLEX‑RN and OSCE – Candidates in Stream A must pass the NCLEX‑RN
exam and the OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). The
NCLEX‑RN tests your theoretical knowledge while the OSCE assesses your
clinical skills and communication. Stream B or C candidates may need to
complete the Outcome‑Based Assessment (OBA) pathway, which involves
similar exams.
5. Registration and Visa – After passing the NCLEX‑RN and OSCE and
providing all required documents, you can apply for AHPRA registration.
Once registered, you can explore visa options such as the Working
Holiday Visa or employer‑sponsored visas to live and work in Australia
as a registered nurse.
Why Do Nurses Struggle with the AURN Pathway? Many international nurses
underestimate the amount of study required and are surprised by the
different exam formats. Time pressures, work commitments and the stress
of relocating can also make it difficult to prepare effectively. Working
with a specialist training provider ensures you understand the process
and get the support you need.
How NAI Helps – Nurse Assist International provides comprehensive NCLEX
and OSCE review courses, unlimited hands‑on lab practice and experienced
educators who know exactly what Australian regulators expect. From
enrolment through to visa support, NAI guides you at every step so you
can focus on learning.
Becoming an AURN may seem daunting, but with the right guidance and
preparation it’s completely achievable. Whether you’re at the beginning
of your journey or ready to register, Nurse Assist International can
help you reach your goal.
