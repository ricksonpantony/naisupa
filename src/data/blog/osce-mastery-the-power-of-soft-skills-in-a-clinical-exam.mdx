# OSCE Mastery: The Power of Soft Skills in a Clinical Exam

Title : OSCE Mastery: The Power of Soft Skills in a Clinical Exam
OCT 09
Clinical skills are vital, but soft skills often determine your OSCE
score. Here’s why they matter.
Empathy, communication, time management and emotional intelligence are
essential for building rapport with simulated patients and examiners.
Even when your clinical assessment is correct, poor communication can
result in a lower grade. Developing resilience helps you stay calm when
moving quickly from one station to another, and effective time
management ensures you complete all tasks.
When preparing for the OSCE, spend time honing soft skills alongside
clinical practice. Remember: an excellent nurse is compassionate as well
as technically proficient.
