# Managing Anxiety During OSCE Exams

Title : Managing Anxiety During OSCE Exams
NOV 16
Feeling anxious before the OSCE is normal, but excessive anxiety can
impair performance. This guide offers practical tips to manage stress.
Recognize Why You’re Anxious – Fear of evaluation, uncertainty about the
exam format and self‑doubt are common triggers.
Prepare Thoroughly – Enrol in a comprehensive OSCE review course,
practise regularly and simulate exam conditions. Facilities like NAI’s
simulation labs offer realistic practice opportunities.
Seek Individualised Feedback – Participate in mock exams and one‑on‑one
feedback sessions to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Manage Stress – Use mindfulness techniques, schedule study time
effectively, stay physically active, get adequate sleep and use positive
affirmations. Confidence comes from preparation and self‑care.
