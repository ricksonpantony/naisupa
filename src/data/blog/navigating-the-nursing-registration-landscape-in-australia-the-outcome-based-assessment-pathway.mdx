#  Navigating the Nursing Registration Landscape in Australia: The Outcome Based Assessment Pathway

Title :
Navigating the Nursing Registration Landscape in Australia: The Outcome Based Assessment Pathway
DEC 13
The Outcome‑Based Assessment (OBA) pathway allows internationally
educated nurses to obtain registration in Australia through a structured
process.
Application and Eligibility – Submit an application to AHPRA, undergo a
self‑assessment and provide documents such as transcripts and employment
history.
Competency Assessment – Complete the NCLEX‑RN exam and the OSCE to
demonstrate theoretical knowledge and clinical skills.
Supervised Practice – After passing the exams, complete a period of
supervised practice in an approved healthcare facility.
Registration – On successful completion of supervised practice, apply
for full registration and explore visa options.
The OBA pathway recognises prior experience, offers flexibility and
streamlines the route to becoming a registered nurse in Australia.
Understanding NMBA standards, preparing thoroughly and seeking expert
guidance will help you navigate the process.
