# Learn About the Varied Field of Nursing Careers

Title : Learn About the Varied Field of Nursing Careers
AUG 15
Nursing encompasses far more than bedside care. Explore diverse career
paths and discover where nursing can take you.
Community Health Nursing – Community health nurses focus on illness
prevention, rehabilitation, research and promoting healthy living in
non‑traditional settings like homes, schools and community centres. They
assess community needs, develop educational programs and partner with
local leaders to improve public health.
Telehealth Nursing – Telehealth nurses use digital platforms to assess,
diagnose and monitor patients remotely. They improve access to care for
rural and homebound patients, manage care in partnership with healthcare
teams and conduct virtual consultations.
Nurse Educators – Experienced RNs who become educators convey vital
skills to the next generation of nurses. They combine clinical expertise
with pedagogical knowledge to teach and mentor students.
Nursing Assistance Worldwide – NAI offers comprehensive OSCE and NCLEX
preparation, equipping nurses to pursue diverse specializations and
leadership roles worldwide. Graduates gain the skills and confidence to
excel in areas such as public health, telehealth, research, education
and specialized clinical practice.
