# The Art of Answering NCLEX Psychosocial Integrity Questions

Title : The Art of Answering NCLEX Psychosocial Integrity Questions
JAN 24
Psychosocial integrity questions assess your ability to provide
emotional support and maintain patient dignity. They cover topics such
as therapeutic communication, mental‑health disorders, coping
mechanisms, grief and loss.
Strategies – Think like a counsellor: use open‑ended questions, active
listening and empathy. Always prioritize safety (e.g., suicide risk) and
apply Maslow’s hierarchy. When faced with similar options, pick the most
compassionate choice.
NAI prepares students for psychosocial questions through role‑playing,
case studies and personalized feedback. By focusing on therapeutic
communication and patient‑centred care, you can confidently answer these
questions and provide holistic nursing care.
