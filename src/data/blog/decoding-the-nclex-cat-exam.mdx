# Decoding the NCLEX CAT Exam

Title : Decoding the NCLEX CAT Exam
OCT 25
The NCLEX uses Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT), which adjusts question
difficulty based on your answers. Understanding how CAT works will help
you perform at your best.
What Is CAT? – CAT tailors each exam to the test‑taker. It presents a
question of moderate difficulty and moves up or down depending on
whether you answer correctly.
Why Preparation Matters – Because you can’t skip questions or go back,
you must answer carefully. Practice reduces anxiety and improves
adaptability.
How CAT Measures Competence – The test estimates your ability after each
question. Once it’s confident you’re above or below the passing
standard, the exam ends.
Strategies – Answer each question slowly and confidently, avoid
overthinking, and practise with adaptive simulators. Debunk myths such
as “more questions mean failure” – the number of questions doesn’t
determine your result.
