# Strategies on How to Prepare for the NCLEX NGN

Title : Strategies on How to Prepare for the NCLEX NGN
JUL 18
Preparing for the NCLEX and completing nursing school simultaneously can
be stressful. This article offers coping strategies and study techniques
to help you succeed.
Understand the Pressure – Balancing coursework, clinical rotations and
NCLEX preparation leads to stress and self‑doubt.
Prioritize Social Support – Connect with friends, family and study
groups. Sharing experiences and encouragement fosters motivation and
reduces loneliness.
Develop Emotional Intelligence – Improve resilience by recognising and
managing your emotions and those of others. Build self‑awareness,
cultivate curiosity and embrace mistakes as learning opportunities.
Practise Self‑Care – Schedule time for rest, exercise and hobbies to
maintain energy and prevent burnout. Consider simple leisure activities
on your days off.
Increase Job Satisfaction – Seek feedback, maintain work‑life balance
and celebrate accomplishments. Happy nurses perform better and are less
likely to burn out.
Finish Each Day Positively – Start shifts prepared and end them with
gratitude. Establish rituals to mark the beginning and end of your
workday and leave with a sense of closure.
Balancing work, life and exam preparation requires a proactive approach
to self‑care and support.
