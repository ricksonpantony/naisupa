# Image Loading Fix Summary
**Date:** October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blog Pages Not Loading
**Problem:** All blog post pages were failing to load due to incorrect import paths.

**Root Cause:** Blog post files in `src/pages/blogs/news/` were importing from `'../utils/imageStorage'` instead of `'../../../utils/imageStorage'`.

**Solution:** Fixed import paths in all 20+ blog post files using sed command:
```bash
find src/pages/blogs/news -name "*.jsx" -exec sed -i '' "s|from '../utils/imageStorage'|from '../../../utils/imageStorage'|g" {} \;
```

**Files Affected:**
- BlogPost1.jsx through BlogPost20.jsx
- BlogPost31.jsx
- All files in `src/pages/blogs/news/`

---

### 2. Hero & Gallery Images Not Loading from Supabase
**Problem:** Hero section and student gallery were using Unsplash placeholder URLs instead of real student images.

**Root Cause:** 
- Supabase storage has Row-Level Security (RLS) policies preventing anonymous uploads
- Images couldn't be uploaded to Supabase buckets
- Only 1 item in gallery bucket instead of hundreds

**Temporary Solution:** Use local images from public directory with URL-encoded paths

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Hero Images (`src/data/heroImages.js`)
- Updated `heroTestimonials` array to use real student images
- Updated `heroGridStudents` array with 20 student images
- Changed from Unsplash URLs to local paths: `/Gallery/NAI%20GALLERY/Students/`
- URL-encoded spaces as `%20` for proper browser loading

#### B. Student Gallery (`src/components/StudentGallery.jsx`)
- Removed Supabase `getGalleryImageUrl()` function calls
- Updated 6 featured students with real photos:
  - Aayushma Koirala (Nepal)
  - Abhay Sharma (India)
  - Airi Sano (Japan)
  - Akindele Titilayo (Nigeria)
  - Aneesha Gottamukkala (India)
  - Bianca Asuncion (Philippines)
- All images now load from `/Gallery/NAI%20GALLERY/Students/` with proper URL encoding

#### C. Image Directory Setup
Copied images from backup to public directory:
```bash
cp -r backup/local-images/Gallery/* public/Gallery/
cp -r backup/local-images/Team/* public/Team/
```

## Current Status

✅ **Development Server:** Running successfully on http://localhost:5173/  
✅ **Blog Pages:** Loading without errors  
✅ **Hero Images:** Real student images displaying  
✅ **Gallery Images:** Student photos loading from local directory

## Future Steps (To Use Supabase in Production)

### Option 1: Fix Supabase RLS Policies
1. Run SQL script: `enable-anonymous-uploads.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
2. Re-run upload script: `node scripts/upload-images.js`
3. Update image paths to use `getGalleryImageUrl()` functions
4. Remove anonymous upload policies after successful upload

### Option 2: Continue with Local Images
- Keep images in `public/` directory
- Deploy with Netlify/Vercel which will serve static assets
- No Supabase storage needed for images
- Simpler deployment and faster loading

## Additional Fix: Blog Images Not Showing

### Problem
After fixing the import paths, blog images still weren't displaying because:
1. Blog images weren't copied to `public/blog-images/`
2. General images (like ALLTECHZONE.webp) weren't copied to `public/Images/`
3. Blog posts were calling `getGeneralImageUrl()` which tried to fetch from Supabase

### Solution
1. **Copied blog images:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/blog-images && cp -r backup/local-images/blog-images/* public/blog-images/
   ```

2. **Copied general images:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/Images && cp -r backup/local-images/Images/* public/Images/
   ```

3. **Replaced Supabase function calls with local paths:**
   ```bash
   # In all blog post files
   find src/pages/blogs/news -name "*.jsx" -exec sed -i '' "s|getGeneralImageUrl('ALLTECHZONE.webp')|'/Images/ALLTECHZONE.webp'|g" {} \;
   
   # In main BlogPost.jsx
   sed -i '' "s|getGeneralImageUrl('ALLTECHZONE.webp')|'/Images/ALLTECHZONE.webp'|g" src/pages/BlogPost.jsx
   ```

### Images Now Available
- ✅ `/blog-images/b1.webp` through `/blog-images/b12.webp` + b31.webp
- ✅ `/Images/ALLTECHZONE.webp` (author avatar)
- ✅ `/Images/australia-nursing.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/medication-safety.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/nclex-preparation.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/nursing-communication.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/nursing-education.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/nursing-support.webp`
- ✅ `/Images/osce.webp`
